# âœ¨ Project Overview
This is a simple, command-line To-Do List application built with Python. It allows users to manage their daily tasks by providing a simple text-based interface to add, view, and remove items from a list.

This project was built as a fundamental exercise during the "100 Days of Python" course to practice core Python concepts like functions, lists, loops, and user input.


# Features
* **Add Tasks**: Quickly enter a new task to be added to the list.

* **View Tasks:** Display all current tasks in a numbered, readable format.

* **Remove Tasks:** Select a task to remove by its number.

* **Quit:** Exit the application cleanly.
